Find God in Niagara
===================

Places of worship in the Niagara Region

Made during the 2013 [Open Data Day Hackathon in Niagara, ON](http://opendata2013.softwareniagara.com/).

I was browsing the open datasets from the city of Niagara Falls and the Niagara
Region when I noticed they have a dataset in common, places of worship. So with
just a few hours to get something done, I decided to quickly map all these churches.

I used [Google Fusion Tables](http://tables.googlelabs.com), an experimental app
from Google Drive, to easily organize and visualize the data. Combine that with
the Google Maps API v3 and GitHub Pages, and that's the webpage.
